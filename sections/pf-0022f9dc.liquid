Since pregnancy officially begins on the start date of your last menstrual period, most people won’t have a positive result until week four of their pregnancy. <br><br>It’s also possible that your doctor won’t schedule an appointment until at least week eight because of the risk of miscarriage before week twelve, unless you qualify as a high-risk pregnancy. According to <a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/miscarriage.aspx" target="_blank">March of Dimes</a>, most miscarriages occur before the 12-week mark, and 10-15% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage.</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-36_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-38_">However, there may be some reasons you need to reveal your news early in the first trimester. <a href="https://nurtureand.com/blogs/news/your-first-trimester-of-pregnancy" target="_blank">In this article</a> you can learn about some of the most common symptoms in early pregnancy, including morning sickness, fatigue, and frequent urination. <br><br>Depending on the severity of your symptoms or your work situation, for example, if you are a teacher who will need extra bathroom visits, you may feel it is necessary to clue some close friends or coworkers into what is happening.
