Babies need a ton of supplies, so walking into a vast baby shop or browsing online can quickly become overwhelming.<br> <br>A registry checklist will help you stay organized and focused; however, it is okay to add a few items here and there spontaneously.&nbsp;Each couple will have their individual registry needs, but there are a handful of areas all new parents should have covered.
<br><br>Check with the stores you are interested in registering with to <span style="font-weight: bold;">see what perks they offer.</span> For example, some stores will allow returns of anything purchased directly from your registry without a receipt. <br><br>Another perk is a discount on unpurchased items off your registry for a time period, sometimes until your baby’s first birthday! If you decide to register with multiple stores, an increasing trend, consider keeping your own checklist of items you’ve received versus what you still need.

<br><br>By week-20, you’ll likely know if you’re having a boy or a girl, and while that won’t make a difference for some essential items, it may affect your nursery decor and clothing selections. Or maybe to some parents this is not important.
<br><br>Even if you’re waiting to find out the baby’s gender or opting for more gender-neutral selections, baby showers typically aren’t held until the <a href="https://nurtureand.com/blogs/news/your-third-trimester-of-pregnancy" target="_self">third trimester</a>. <br><br>Most stores offer the ability to build your registry entirely online. If you’d rather have the chance to touch and see things in person, head to customer service or the registry department of any major retailer or baby boutique to get started.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check store policies</span> about shipping speed and costs as that can impact a person’s decision on what to buy and how much to spend. <a href="https://nurtureand.com/collections/#gliders" target="_self">Nurture&amp; gliders</a> include free shipping for orders over $650 and free returns, meaning you can purchase with confidence.</span></p><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" id="Subtitle-3" class="sc-gXfVKN hOTIIO pf-36_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-38_">Items to include on your Baby Registry Checklist</span></h2><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/preparationofformulaforbabyfeedingrp6jrvn-1632279680731.jpg?v=1632279690" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/preparationofformulaforbabyfeedingrp6jrvn-1632279680731.jpg?v=1632279690 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/preparationofformulaforbabyfeedingrp6jrvn-1632279680731_500x.jpg?v=1632279690 320w" width="555" height="370" title="Nursery Glider" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-39_"/><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" id="Subtitle-3" class="sc-gXfVKN hOTIIO pf-40_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-42_">Diapering</span></h3><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-43_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-45_">You will need a few essential items in the diapering department, but limit requests for diapers and wipes.
