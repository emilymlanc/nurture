They are part of oral tradition passed down from generation to generation. <br><br>These traditions are used to predict the future or explain superstitious beliefs, and while most of them have no basis in fact or science, they can be fun to learn about! One area that has an abundance of old wives’ tales is pregnancy. <br><br>Some examples of popular pregnancy beliefs are that the foods you crave while pregnant will predict what your baby will like later on, or that excessive heartburn means your baby will have a lot of hair. <br><br>While these tales may or may not have that much truth to them, it is fun to use them in an attempt to predict your baby’s gender! If you’re interested in giving gender predictions a try, read on for a breakdown of the how, why, and reliability behind some of the most popular ones.

</span></h2><p class="sc-fHCHyC hTGTkL pf-40_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-42_">Many old wives’ tales used to predict gender are based on pregnancy symptoms. For example, craving sweet things means you’re having a girl, while little to no morning sickness means a boy. <br><br>In reality, your <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282652033_Relationship_Between_Fetal_Sex_and_Nausea_and_Vomiting_During_Pregnancy" target="_blank">morning sickness</a> is  caused by hormones and nutritional needs rather than the gender of your baby. 

Even though very few of these ideas are based on medical advice or tested science, women worldwide swear by them. <br><br>Here we look to see which, if any, of these traditions are rooted in  any modern scientific reasoning, although I wouldn’t pick out any baby names based on the results!
</span></p><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-eirqVv ugLHX pf-44_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-46_">The Belly</span></h3><p class="sc-fHCHyC hTGTkL pf-47_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-49_">Are you carrying high or low? This old wives’ tale says that if you carry high, it is a girl, and low means you’re having a baby boy. However, in reality it’s more likely that if you carry high, it is your first baby or you are a fit person with a solid stomach and strong abdominal muscles. 
<br><br>All pregnant women experience weight gain, but there is a superstition that if you carry your weight out front, your baby will be a little girl while if you gained your extra weight on the hips means you’re carrying a boy. However, doctors say where you carry your baby weight <span style="font-weight: bold;">depends on your body shape.

However, <span style="font-weight: bold;">there is zero scientific evidence</span> to support this since the color of your urine changes daily.</span></p><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-eirqVv ugLHX pf-62_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-64_">Sympathy Weight

While there is a syndrome called Couvade Syndrome, or sympathetic pregnancy, it has nothing to do with gender.

For example, it’s said that if the fetal heart rate is under 140 bpm, it is a boy. While this is false, it is based on some truth. <a href="https://www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/Patients-Families/Health-Library/HealthDocNew/Old-Wives-Tales" target="_blank">Once labor has begun,</a> a girl’s heart rate is usually higher than a boy’s.

Tie your wedding ring to a piece of string and dangle it over your belly. If the ring swings from the left side to the right, you are having a boy. A ring spinning in a circle means a girl.
