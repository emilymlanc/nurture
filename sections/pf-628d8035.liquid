There are many ways to go about researching and choosing your main theme. <br><br>For example, some couples browse online for ideas, while others decide on a color scheme first. Try using websites such as Pinterest to search for and compile nursery ideas. <br><br>It is beneficial to start with a focal point and build your baby’s room around a particular piece, such as an area rug, glider, or wall decals. Having a central piece or idea will help focus your process. <br><br>For example, maybe you love the idea of a nature-themed nursery, or perhaps you are beachgoers and want to incorporate your love of the ocean into the room. <br><br>Once you’ve decided on a theme or focal point, choose a color palette. Then, begin by adding other ideas and pieces to your design concept. Remember, you are designing a room for a baby, so it is best to keep the design simple yet engaging. <br><br>To add some character, consider adding decals or engaging artwork to your nursery walls. These pieces can give your little one something to look at and entertain them while their vision develops.</span></p><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" id="Subtitle-2" class="sc-dPaNzc kXWuay pf-30_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-32_">Start Building</span></h2><p class="sc-daBunf bWmajK pf-33_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-35_">If you’re feeling overwhelmed and unsure where to start, consider using a mood board to gather ideas. Mood boards can be digital renderings or a combination of photos, drawings, fabric scraps, or even paint color cards.&nbsp;<br><br>Once you have your basic theme decided, it is time to purchase your basic nursery decor. First, you’ll need furniture pieces like a changing table, crib, <a href="https://nurtureand.com/blogs/news/why-is-the-glider-the-most-important-purchase-in-the-nursery" target="_self">rocker or glider</a>, and dresser. The neutral colors of the Nurture&amp; <a href="https://nurtureand.com/products/the-glider" target="_self">Glider</a> and <a href="https://nurtureand.com/products/the-glider-plus" target="_self">Glider+</a>&nbsp;work well in any space, and <a href="https://nurtureand.com/products/the-swivel" target="_self">The Swivel </a>is ideal for small spaces.</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/pf-86b3a71f--Ivory-gliderangleno-modeluprightRS.jpg?v=1628544508" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/pf-86b3a71f--Ivory-gliderangleno-modeluprightRS.jpg?v=1628544508 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/pf-86b3a71f--Ivory-gliderangleno-modeluprightRS_500x.jpg?v=1628544508 320w" width="555" height="370" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-khIgEk hQhHpX pf-36_"/><p class="sc-daBunf bWmajK pf-37_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-39_">Once you have your nursery furniture in place, you can begin painting, hanging window treatments, and adding additional decor. If you are painting, plan ahead, so the room has plenty of time to air out before the baby arrives. You may also want to consider non-toxic paints to use for the room as well. <br><br>A final tip when looking at nursery themes is to consider the space available. It is important to avoid clutter, especially if you have a small nursery. <br><br>For example, your changing table must have everything within reach while keeping the crib far enough away from the changing table to prevent your baby from reaching potentially dangerous items.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" id="Subtitle-3" class="sc-dPaNzc kXWuay pf-40_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-42_">Nursery Design Dos</span></h2><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-dPaNzc kXWuay pf-43_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-45_">Choose textiles before paint</span></h3><p class="sc-daBunf bWmajK pf-46_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-48_">When working in interior design, it is always best to choose textiles before paint colors. Then, once you have your furniture and color scheme in place, you can bring paint color samples to the room to see what works best. The lighting in the room may affect how colors appear, so it is always best to view paint samples in the actual room.</span></p><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-dPaNzc kXWuay pf-49_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-51_">Decorate the ceiling</span></h3><p class="sc-daBunf bWmajK pf-52_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-54_">Consider using wall decals on the ceiling above your baby’s crib. These easy-to-apply DIY decals are an excellent way to entertain your baby during those late-night wake-ups. The upside of using decals is that they are removable and won’t damage walls. <br><br>If you are renting or don’t want to worry about a major room makeover as your child ages, decals are the perfect option to add some personality!</span></p><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-dPaNzc kXWuay pf-55_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-57_">Build eco-friendly nursery</span></h3><p class="sc-daBunf bWmajK pf-58_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-60_">Unfortunately, many baby toys and paints used in furniture contain toxic or harmful chemicals. Consider using green products as well as purchasing an eco-friendly crib. All of the materials used to make <a href="https://nurtureand.com/collections/#gliders" target="_self">Nurture&amp; products</a>&nbsp;are non-toxic and baby-safe.</span></p><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-dPaNzc kXWuay pf-61_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-63_">Create a nursing station and sanitation station

There will be more late-night feedings than you can count, so part of your perfect nursery should be a comfortable place to nurse or bottle-feed. <br><br><a href="https://nurtureand.com/collections/#gliders" target="_self">The Glider and Glider+</a> both have power recline, adjustable headsets, and built-in USB chargers, making them a comfortable and convenient place to relax while feeding your baby.</span></p><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-dPaNzc kXWuay pf-67_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-69_">Keep storage in mind</span></h3><p class="sc-daBunf bWmajK pf-70_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-72_">One essential part of any kid’s room is storage. You will need a safe place to store clothing, supplies, and toys. Large, soft baskets are ideal for storing books and toys and prevent accidental entrapment.
<br><br>If using a changing table and dresser combo, use the top drawer to store extra diapers, wipes, diaper cream, etc. To babyproof, you can place child safety latches on the drawers to prevent your child from pinching fingers or getting into supplies.</span></p><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-dPaNzc kXWuay pf-73_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-75_">Leave room to grow</span></h3><p class="sc-daBunf bWmajK pf-76_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-78_">While it seems impossible to imagine your baby girl or boy as a full-blown toddler, it will happen in a blink of an eye. Therefore, you should think long-term when designing your nursery. <br><br>Look at cribs that convert into toddler beds. Also, consider purchasing gender-neutral nursery pieces like a Nurture&amp; glider that stays timeless or could be repurposed in your home decor as a piece of living room furniture.

All of these statement pieces work just as well in a baby boy nursery or a girl’s room and provide a pop of personality.

In addition, opt for bulbs with natural lighting effects.&nbsp;</span></p><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-dPaNzc kXWuay pf-102_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-104_">Forgetting the nightlight</span></h3><p class="sc-daBunf bWmajK pf-105_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-107_">A nightlight is an essential piece of nursery decor. Soft, gentle light can keep your baby calm when they wake up late at night by providing a comfortable glow that allows them to recognize their surroundings.
<br><br>A baby who recognizes where they are and is safe, especially as they begin learning how to sleep through the night, is less likely to cry and wake up mom and dad!
<br><br>A nightlight also allows you to enter the room without turning on additional lights, especially for the middle of the night diaper changes, keeping the room’s atmosphere calm and sleepy.

So it is never too early to begin baby-proofing. It is recommended that you start child-proofing before your baby is even born. Waiting until your baby is here and you are a sleep-deprived parent facing a host of new challenges makes it more likely that you will miss a crucial step.
<br><br>When child-proofing, make sure you secure all cabinets and doors, put all cords and wires out of baby’s reach, and fix all heavy pieces of furniture to the wall, including televisions.
