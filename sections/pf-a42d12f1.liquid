The good news is that fatigue usually subsides with the onset of the<a href="https://nurtureand.com/blogs/news/your-second-trimester-of-pregnancy" target="_self"> second trimester. </a><br><br>Increased progesterone levels can also make you feel unusually warm, which makes it difficult to sleep for some. Consider adding a fan to your room or purchasing a cooling blanket.<br><br>In addition to simply feeling better, adequate sleep is needed to help with memory, appetite, mood, critical thinking, and decision-making skills. Another crucial reason you need a good night’s sleep is that it <a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=90&amp;ContentID=P02362" target="_blank">promotes blood circulation</a>: <br><br>An unborn baby requires nutrition and oxygen from the placenta. A good night’s sleep promotes blood vessels to regenerate and increases blood flow to the developing baby via the placenta and umbilical cord. <br><br>Sleep deprivation is also linked to preeclampsia, a dangerous condition that causes a spike in blood pressure that can lead to preterm labor. In addition, the lack of sleep can cause other dangerous problems like gestational diabetes and or preterm labor. <br><br>And sleep doesn’t only affect your health physically; lack of sleep also alters your mood and emotional health. When you sleep better, you feel better. Maintaining a positive mood through the ups and downs of pregnancy can help you stay upbeat through this emotionally challenging time.</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/croppedviewofyoungpregnantafricanamericanwo20210903165443utc-1635169780499.jpg?v=1635169794" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/croppedviewofyoungpregnantafricanamericanwo20210903165443utc-1635169780499.jpg?v=1635169794 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/croppedviewofyoungpregnantafricanamericanwo20210903165443utc-1635169780499_500x.jpg?v=1635169794 320w" width="555" height="370" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-khIgEk hQhHpX pf-36_"/><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" id="Subtitle-2" class="sc-dPaNzc kXWuay pf-30_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ikXwFM hZHGfK pf-32_">Common Sleep Disorders During Pregnancy

<br><br>Sleeping on your back after twenty weeks can cause a drop in blood pressure as your growing uterus and baby pushes down on the large veins in your lower back, also known as your inferior vena cava. <br>But if you find yourself having nodded off on your back, don’t stress; simply change positions.
<br><br>One of the best items that you can gift yourself is a pregnancy pillow. Pregnancy pillows can be a lifesaver when looking for a comfortable sleeping position.
