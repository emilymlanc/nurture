It will be especially helpful during the newborn days, as you’ll be spending the majority of your waking hours either feeding or rocking the baby, both of which are easily done in this chair. <br><br>It is estimated that you and your baby will spend roughly 930 hours, the equivalent of 39 days, in the glider during the first six months of their life.</span></p><p class="sc-fHCHyC hTGTkL pf-30_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-32_">The gentle rocking motion of a glider calms your baby when he or she is upset, as it reminds babies of being inside the womb. Rocking is a naturally comforting sensation to humans in general; recent research performed by the <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822%2811%2900539-2#app2" target="_blank">University of Geneva</a> shows that adults are also comforted by a gentle rocking motion.</span></p><p class="sc-fHCHyC hTGTkL pf-33_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-35_">Additionally, the glider is used as a place to feed your baby. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/InfantandToddlerNutrition/breastfeeding/how-much-and-how-often.html" target="_blank">CDC</a> states that your baby should be fed 8 to 12 times every 24 hours during the first few months of his or her life, whether you are breastfeeding or formula feeding. Each of those feedings normally lasts 30 minutes or more. That’s a lot of time spent in this chair!</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/pf-cf853a2e--nurtureinfografia.jpg?v=1629122961" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/pf-cf853a2e--nurtureinfografia.jpg?v=1629122961 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/pf-cf853a2e--nurtureinfografia_500x.jpg?v=1629122961 320w" width="555" height="282" title="How long do you use a nursery glider" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-fbIWvP jREztg pf-36_"/><p class="sc-fHCHyC hTGTkL pf-37_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-39_">That’s why, when choosing the nursery chair that’s best for you, comfort should be top of mind while you’re evaluating your options.</span></p><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" id="Subtitle-2" class="sc-eirqVv ugLHX pf-40_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-42_">Why Do Moms Need a Nursery Glider?</span></h2><p class="sc-fHCHyC hTGTkL pf-43_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-45_">Birth is an incredible experience, but it’s also a lot of trauma to a mom’s body. Mamas need time and space to recover appropriately. During the initial postpartum period, you’ll want to rest as often as possible, to help your body recover. <br><br>Doctors will advise most mothers to sit often, and elevate your feet to reduce swelling and take pressure off your back. A power recliner is super helpful for this reason, as the smooth recline makes the transition from sitting to standing much easier. <br><br>A glider with a recline feature (or a glider-recliner) is also helpful for mothers as the reclining can help with lower backaches and ab separation that occurs before and after the delivery.
</span></p><p class="sc-fHCHyC hTGTkL pf-46_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-48_">According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/delivery.htm" target="_blank">CDC,</a> approximately 31% of all births in the U.S. are C-sections. Women who have C-sections should especially not engage in strenuous physical activity; most doctors will recommend staying fully off your feet for at least two weeks, as you will have undergone major surgery. <br><br>A power reclining chair helps with recovery as the reclining position helps you elevate your feet - you’re even able to control the degree of the recline as well, by adjusting the power button to your liking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-fHCHyC hTGTkL pf-49_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-51_">Dads and partners will also benefit from a comfortable nursery chair. If your partner is helping with feedings and bedtime routines, they will be spending a lot of time in the chair too -  you’ll want to find one that is comfortable for both of you, and most importantly, can fit both of you. A glider recliner is a perfect spot to relax after a late-night feeding.&nbsp;</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/pf-7baa8ffa--dadbaby.jpg?v=1628869081" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/pf-7baa8ffa--dadbaby.jpg?v=1628869081 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/pf-7baa8ffa--dadbaby_500x.jpg?v=1628869081 320w" width="555" height="370" title="Man Holding His Baby" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-fbIWvP jREztg pf-52_"/><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" id="Subtitle-3" class="sc-eirqVv ugLHX pf-53_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-55_">What to Look For in a Nursery Glider</span></h2><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-eirqVv ugLHX pf-56_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-58_">Power Recline</span></h3><p class="sc-fHCHyC hTGTkL pf-59_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-61_">A chair with a power recline offers smoother movements than a manual recliner, which is beneficial when getting up with a sleeping baby - no jerky movements to get the chair to an upright position. As mentioned earlier, if you have had a C-section, you need to stay off your feet as much as possible for two weeks. A recliner with a footrest provides a comfortable spot to relax and cuddle your new baby.</span></p><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-eirqVv ugLHX pf-62_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-64_">Supportive Cushioning</span></h3><p class="sc-fHCHyC hTGTkL pf-65_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-67_">Since you will be sitting with your baby a lot, you’ll want comfortable, soft, and supportive cushioning.

You want a chair with a smooth, gentle, gliding motion. A smooth glide allows you to snuggle your little one into a soft slumber much faster.  Nothing is more frustrating than rocking your baby to sleep, only to stand up and wake them with a jerky movement. </span></p><div data-pf-type="Custom.HTML" class="sc-lbVvki ghCdOs pf-80_"><div class = "subscribe-below">

Much as you would adjust the driver's seat in a car to make the drive more comfortable, you should find a glider that offers the same benefits. <br><br>Look for a chair with an adjustable headrest to make the fit more comfortable - this is helpful for people of different sizes to adjust the comfortability of a chair to his or her liking.</span></p><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-eirqVv ugLHX pf-93_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-95_">Fabric That Can Stand Up to Spit</span></h3><p class="sc-fHCHyC hTGTkL pf-96_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-98_">You want a chair that matches your nursery color scheme, but also stands up to tough stains.

Will it always stay in the nursery, or is there a chance it will become a living room piece as the baby ages? Just because your glider starts as baby gear doesn’t mean it will stay that way. Many people repurpose their nursery chair as a piece in their living spaces, so consider its durability and design when purchasing. </span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/pf-853a2eab--196020Navy01f.jpg?v=1629123027" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/pf-853a2eab--196020Navy01f.jpg?v=1629123027 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0283/0227/8795/t/31/assets/pf-853a2eab--196020Navy01f_500x.jpg?v=1629123027 320w" width="555" height="312" title="Nursery Glider" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-fbIWvP jREztg pf-105_"/><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" id="Subtitle-4" class="sc-eirqVv ugLHX pf-106_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-108_">Glider vs. Rocker</span></h2><p class="sc-fHCHyC hTGTkL pf-109_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-fmdNqN hyACbC pf-111_">The glider has many advantages over the traditional rocking chair.
